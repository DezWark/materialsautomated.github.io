To optimize repository performance, the large input files for this example are not stored directly in github. 

They can be obtained by doing:

curl -L https://www.materialsautomated.com/MaterialsAutomated9-uCT-Input.zip > MaterialsAutomated9-uCT-Input.zip
unzip MaterialsAutomated9-uCT-Input.zip

(prefix each line with ! if running these commands within a Jupyter notebook)
